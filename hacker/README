Welcome, hacker hopeful!

Here is your task:

--------------------

Build a website, and deploy it somewhere. 

-------------------
Here are the details:

You are going to build a website that looks up Kitsap County Tax Deed Auctions 
on the Internet, and parses the data about the auctions.

The site will then use google maps or an equivalent service to place the
properties on a map, with data so that someone can browse them and see
where they are located, what the auction starting price is, etc. etc.

The data for these properties is contained in a number of public websites,
so you will need to find a way to import the data into your application
from a variety of sources.

Make it awesome! It should show off your talents at data mining, working with
visual and backend API's and be useful and cool when finished.

The list can be found here: http://kcwppub3.co.kitsap.wa.us/treas/foreclosure.asp

The link on the left of each row takes you to a set of detail links, including
bills from the state.

At a minimum, you should graph any that can be graphed (some may be difficult 
to locate using Google's API), and make sure that you have the following 
detail information:

A. Type of Property
B. Neighborhood
C. Total unpaid tax bill
D. Quality of View according to the assessor / survey

Rock out and kick butt by adding historical price information, photos, etc.

Some Rules:

0) Respect the Kitsap County resources -- don't hammer the servers, don't rely on them realtime -- make a copy of the data for your own use
1) Any language / architecture is fine
2) Any deployment is fine, but we won't pay for deployment, so free might be good.
3) You'll own the code you create, but we're going to want to look at it.
4) It's illegal to contact people based on this data, so don't do it!
5) Do all your work in your own branch; periodically push this branch back
   github so we can see what you're up to.
6) Keep track of the rough amount of time you spend.
